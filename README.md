## About project

The Government of Canada wishes to provide the Canada Food Guide as an online service to improve the health of Canadians. To test the idea an MVP was outlined by the product owner.  They are looking to adopt modern cloud-based methodologies to deploy a scalable healthy eating API.

The roadmap includes adding preference features and automatic weekly shopping lists with options to set up healthy grocery delivery via Amazon Prime. This roadmap is out of scope for this project.
